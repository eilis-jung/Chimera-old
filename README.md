Chimera was(is) a framework for developing and debugging real-time fluid simulation in 2D.

The original code was co-developed by a few researchers in CGL/ETH, based on which I developed a few features for personal projects. 

Unfortunately the code is a bit outdated, and lacks cross-platform compatibility, that it cannot run on modern NVIDIA GPUs. See another project `Sirion`, conceptually following Chimera but implemented with Vulkan/Cpp17+, for more up-to-date works.
